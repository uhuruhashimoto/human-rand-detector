## Human Generated Random Number Detector
Recurrent NN (LSTM) for binary classification of human and random binary strings.

*Important Note: this model does not contain a dataset of a size sufficient to obtain statistically significant results. Users are advised to seek out large online datasets if they want a successful model.*
## Build
`pip install requirements.txt`
`make` in corresponding subdirectory for text generation/manipulation with string handlers
## Usage
`python3 lstm.py`
